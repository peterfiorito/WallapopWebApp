# Wallapop Product Search App

Hello! This app was Build in angular.js, so for correct visualization be sure to run the app in a local server (you can do this with node.js).
Also, to get the JSON file with the products it uses a mocked up json server, I used json-server and set it up in the default port which is :3000.

Thanks for reading!
